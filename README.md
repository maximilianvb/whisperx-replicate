This repo is the codebase behind the following Replicate models, which we use at [Upmeet](https://upmeet.ai):

- [victor-upmeet/whisperx](https://replicate.com/victor-upmeet/whisperx) : if you don't know which model to use, use this one. It uses a low-cost hardware, which suits most cases
- [victor-upmeet/whisperx-a40-large](https://replicate.com/victor-upmeet/whisperx-a40-large) : if you encounter some memory issues with previous models, consider this one. It can happen when dealing with long audio files and performing alignment and/or diarization
- [victor-upmeet/whisperx-a100-80gb](https://replicate.com/victor-upmeet/whisperx-a100-80gb) : if you encounter some memory issues with previous models, consider this one. It can happen when dealing with long audio files and performing alignment and/or diarization

# Model Information

WhisperX provides fast automatic speech recognition (70x realtime with large-v3) with word-level timestamps and speaker diarization.

Whisper is an ASR model developed by OpenAI, trained on a large dataset of diverse audio. Whilst it does produces highly accurate transcriptions, the corresponding timestamps are at the utterance-level, not per word, and can be inaccurate by several seconds. OpenAIâ€™s whisper does not natively support batching, but WhisperX does.

Model used is for transcription is large-v3 from faster-whisper.

For more information about WhisperX, including implementation details, see the [WhisperX github repo](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX).
